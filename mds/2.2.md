# 2.2 Visualization of proteins

## Visual representations of proteins

Different models can be used for visualization of proteins:
- Line model
- Space Filling model
- Ball & sticks
- Main chain trace
- C-Alpha trace
- Simple diagrams
- Cartoon diagrams

## Molecular Surfaces
Can be represented using:
- Van der waals surface: represents a imaginary hard sphere which can be used to model atoms as rigid bodies.
- Solvent accesible surface: Van der Waals surface + 1.4A (surface not accesible is called Re-entrant or solvent excluded surface)
- Dot Surface: Display points at a given distance from atom center (I.e Solvent accesible surface), and remove the interior dots
- Gaussian surface (two parameters, can have different levels of smoothing)

## Marching cubes algorithm
Creates a grid, checks which points are inside the surface, which outside, and which in between, and assigns edges to the voxels that are between.

## Radius of gyration
$R^2 = \frac {1}{N}\sum(r_k - r_{mean})^2 \to$ 
Squared eviation from the centroid along each axis
